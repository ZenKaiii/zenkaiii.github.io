Hey, I am Zenkai (a.k.a. _@Zenkaiii_). I worked on the Vehicle Cloud Platform System at <del>Huawei</del>Yinwang.

I considered myself as a hybrid between a software engineer specifically into the programming languages theories and implementations domain (i.e. compiler, type system, type-based formal verification, virtual machine, runtime systems, garbage collection), and a creative technologiest deeply caring about many humanistic aspects (e.g. visual, sound, interaction) in UI and HCI in general.
